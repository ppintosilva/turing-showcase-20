  \begin{block}{Recurring traffic bottlenecks}

    \heading{What are recurring bottlenecks?}

        Bottlenecks are one of the main sources of traffic \emph{congestion}.
        In particular, recurring bottlenecks are characterised by their
        predictability: when and where they occur, and their impact on traffic
        flow. Recurring bottlenecks, as opposed to congestion caused by sporadic
        incidents, are of special interest to traffic managers because they are
        associated with operational deficiencies often eligible for remediation.
        The identification and ranking of bottlenecks, in terms of experienced
        delay and variability, is therefore crucial for the prioritisation of
        interventions aimed at mitigating bottleneck-induced congestion
        \cite{spiller2017}.

      \caption{Schematic of a bottleneck.}
      \label{fig:}
    \end{wrapfigure}

    An active bottleneck has four distinctive features:
    (i) congestion upstream of the bottleneck,
    characterised by slower speeds and longer travel times, (ii) free flow
    conditions downstream of the location, (iii) operation under
    considerable demand and (iv) the existence of a specific point where traffic
    breaksdown and a queue starts to form upstream, in other words, a clear
    indication that congestion is localised rather than systemic.

    \heading{Knowledge gap}

    Research on bottleneck identification and their impact has been done
    almost exclusively on \emph{highways}:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Highways carry large volumes of traffic and bottlenecks can
            incur severe economic and social costs.
      \item Highways approximate idealised roads, with few entry and exit
            points, which makes the measurement of traffic flow easier and less
            costly.
    \end{itemize}

    Local authorities can greatly benefit from extending the body of
    research to a larger variety of roads. % and urban networks.

  \begin{alertblock}{Opportunity: Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras}

    % ANPR cameras distinguish themselves from traditional traffic sensors, such
    % as loop detectors and CCTV cameras, by their ability to identify and record
    % the number plate of vehicles. Local traffic authorities have started to
    % employ large groups of ANPR cameras in corridors across urban centres in
    % order to actively monitor and report traffic conditions, particularly travel
    % time, to drivers in real-time.
    Local authorities have started to employ large groups of ANPR cameras
    across urban centres to actively monitor traffic conditions, particularly
    travel time, and report them to back to drivers \cite{silva2018}.

    An instance of the bottleneck identification problem is depicted in
    Figure \ref{fig:motivating_example_map}. The A1504 Killingworthway
    roundabout is a well known bottleneck which slows down vehicles that
    travelling North (location 'A') and then Westbound (location 'C' via 'B').
    The effect can be observed in Figure \ref{fig:motivating_example_1dayplots},
    which depicts the count (left) and mean speed (right) of vehicles driving
    through each segment of the corridor, on 5-minute time windows. We can
    clearly see that vehicles move generally slower on the first segment,
    particularly during the evening peak-hour, a behaviour suggestive of
    bottleneck activation.

    % We do this by building a statistical model of traffic state.

    \heading{Activation model}

    We design our approach based on the model for freeway bottlenecks specified
    in \cite{chen2004}.
    Let $C = \{ s_j \}_{j=1}^{n}$ denote a road corridor monitored by a series
    of ANPR cameras placed along its path, where $s_j$ designates the $j$th
    segment (camera-pair) of the corridor. The sensors generate
    observations of traffic speed and flow, represented by $v(s_j, t)$ and
    $q(s_j, t)$ respectively, at each segment $j$ and time interval $t$. We are
    interested in whether the segments of $C$ are operating under localised
    congestion, particularly under the effect of a bottleneck. Let $A(s_j,t)$
    be a binary variable which indicates the presence of an active bottleneck in
    segment $j$ during time period $t$. We specify $A=1$ if the following
    inequalities are met:

    \vspace{-0.25cm}

    \begin{align}
    v(s_j, t) &< \theta \cdot v_f(s_j) \label{eq:active1} \\[10pt]
    \frac{v(s_{j+1}, t)}{v(s_j, t)} &> \frac{v_f(s_{j+1})}{v_f(s_j)} + \phi \label{eq:active2} \\[10pt]
    q(s_j, t) &> q_m(s_j) \label{eq:active3}
    \end{align}

    where $v_f(s_j)$ denotes the segment expected value of free flow speed;
     $q_m(s_j)$ indicates the typical-day median flow; $\theta$ is the
    upstream congestion factor; and $\phi$ is the factor that determines a
    substantial downstream speed gain.

    Criterion \ref{eq:active1} represents the presence of congestion upstream
    of the bottleneck; expression \ref{eq:active2} symbolises improved traffic
    flow downstream, operating in or close to free flow; and condition
    \ref{eq:active3} suggests user demand is within medium to high levels.
    We can not determine, however, the exact location of the bottleneck and
    where traffic breaksdown (we may be able to infer it in some cases).

  \heading{Bottleneck activation results}

  We consider the parameters $v_f(s_j)$ and $q_m(s_j)$ to be free and estimate
  them heuristically using baseline speed and flow data. The two other
  parameters, $\theta$ and $\phi$, are set according to values used in
  \cite{chen2004} and \cite{he2016}. The initial results, depicted in Figure
  \ref{fig:motivating_example_5week}, are promising albeit not without its
  caveats (see below).

  \begin{block}{Scaling identification across the whole network}

      \heading{The corridor labelling problem}

      To identify bottlenecks we are required to understand which camera tuples
      correspond to valid and popular vehicle journeys. We name these
      \emph{corridors} and the process of discovering them
      \emph{corridor labelling}.

        \subfloat{\includegraphics[width=0.35\linewidth]{MOTIVATION-roadnet-pairs.pdf}}\quad\quad

      \textbf{Other challenges and limitations}: Difficulty of evaluation,
      lack of a generative model, assumed trajectories, increased error rate
      with severe traffic congestion.
